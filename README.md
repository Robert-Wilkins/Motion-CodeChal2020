# Motion R&D - Coding Challenge 2020
This is Robert Wilkins' Weta Motion R&amp;D Software Developer coding challenge submission.

This was my first time ever using pyqt or any dedicated User Interface scripting, so this week has been a very enjoyable, self-driven crash course. I've been relying heavily on https://www.learnpyqt.com/, especially with their examples and book therein. 


### To Run The Code
Make sure you have Python3 installed and do the following:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Robert-Wilkins/Motion-CodeChal2020.git
$ cd Motion-CodeChal2020
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python MainApplication.py
```
